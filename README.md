You will be building a very simple webservice in go that will store “foo” records in memory. Please feel free to use any public resources that you can find. 


Requirements

1.	Please commit to a public Github repository.
2.	Please include a Makefile that supports “build”, “run”, and “clean” tasks. 
3.	The webservice should run on port 8080.
4.	The foo data structure only needs 2 fields. A “name” field and an “id” field. Both should be string data types. 
5.	It should support a POST endpoint (‘/foo’) that accepts a json foo object and responds with a 200 response code. The value of the id field should be added by this endpoint using a generated UUID.
6.	It should support a GET endpoint (‘foo/{id}’) that responds with a 200 response code if the record is found, or a 404 response code if not found.
7.	It should support a DELETE endpoint (‘foo/{id}’) that responds with a 204 response code if the record is found, or a 404 response code if not found.
8.	Please make sure that your code is formatted with gofmt before committing.
9.	Please send the url of your git repository when you are complete.
